### Problem 1 - Word Break
Given a string *s* and a dictionary of strings *wordDict*, return *true* if *s* can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 300
- 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
- 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
- s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of wordDict are **unique**.





### Problem 2 - Word Break
Given an array of strings strs, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 104
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
